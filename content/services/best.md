This wine is the fruit of a long standing Hungarian-Scandinavian friendship hence the name on the label. Best Friends - Kadarka is the product of the reputable wine growing region of Eger with it's well suited soil and climate. This wine is unique for it's special spiciness, exciting fruitiness and low level of tannin in the background.  Light, almost rose coloured due to the delicate kadarka grape. The light but sophisicated flavour begs repeated tasting to explore the unique flavours. A challenge to produce but the result deserved a gold medal and was voted the best kadarka of 2015.
