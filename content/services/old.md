Old Friends is the blend of Tramini (Gewurtztraminer), widely used in the Alsatian region and Leanyka, from the Carpatian Basin. Both these varieties are grown locally. This wine has a subtle fragrance of flowers with spicy pear and green apple notes with a slight mineral background. Aged for one year in oak barrels.
